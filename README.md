-  Hi 👋 I’m @Sid-the-Slothh
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of programming concepts. Right now, I am looking into basic math-less encryption and learning about using math concepts for more 
robust encryption. I will look into more interesting and advanced concepts once I have my basics down.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and C
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, but any feedback on posted projects would be valued 
- 📫 How to reach me : Discord: Sid #2281
